# 🦁 Pine City Zoo (WIP)(INCOMPLETE!!)

Welcome to the **Pine City Zoo** project! This is a digital brochure-style web app that shares fun facts, history, and details about the animals you can find at Pine City Zoo.

The goal is to help visitors explore the zoo better — from learning about each animal to discovering where they’re located in the park.
